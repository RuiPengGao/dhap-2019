## Coming soon

<!-- The ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting was first held in 2003,
bringing ASEAN’s energy ministers together for dialogue on the
region’s energy resources. The AMEM aims to bring about
cooperation, in the form of regional projects, between member
states. Such projects aid the fulfilment of regional objectives such
as the development and sustainable use of ASEAN’s energy
resources, as well as the facilitation of business between the private
sector and ASEAN’s energy sector. As the demand for energy
continues to rise in ASEAN’s booming economy, there is a pressing
need to address the challenges that lie ahead. As such, delegates
will be required to critically analyse ASEAN’s future on energy
resource development.

## The Question of Alternative Energy Development in Southeast Asia

ASEAN’s growth in terms of economic prosperity brings along a
new set of problems. The rising demand for energy is immense, with
an estimated 50% increase in demand by 2025. ASEAN’s
alternative energy potential remains generally untapped and she
remains heavily reliant on coal, natural gas and oil for energy
generation. This raises questions on the long-term security of
ASEAN’s energy supply. However, with each source of alternative
energy comes its own set of benefits and problems. In addition,
ASEAN’s economic might is apparent but not every country can
afford to invest in alternative energy sources as some are still
developing countries with other pressing needs. Which alternative
energy sources should ASEAN focus on? How can ASEAN ensure
that no country gets left behind? Delegates will be required to
address these concerns in order to protect the energy security of
the region in the years to come.

## The Question of Energy Connectivity in Southeast Asia
ASEAN has made bold plans to create an ASEAN Power Grid (APG)
where member states share energy reserves and eliminate power
generation-demand imbalance, with the objective being to
interconnect the national power grids by 2020. As ideal the notion
of a highly energy connected ASEAN may be, the dream is still
distant. Not every member state is on the same page as some
sideline the APG project to focus on their own national energy
development. The most glaring issue would be the lack of a
regulatory framework that would control and manage the grid
operations, to define technical standards and protocols, and to
regulate the electricity tariffs to be charted for power transfer
across the grid. With projects failing to kick-off as per scheduled,
the APG is way off track. Delegates must draft a roadmap for
APG’s future and guidelines to bring ASEAN together on board this
project, bringing the APG back on track. -->
