The ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM) was first held 
in 2003. The ministers gathered to engage in critical dialogue 
on ASEAN’s energy resources and growing energy requirements. As 
the demand for energy continues to rise in ASEAN’s booming economy, 
delegates will be required to design measures to ensure sustainable energy security in the region.

## 1. The Question of Alternative Energy Development

The rising demand for energy in Southeast Asia is immense, with an estimated 
50% increase in demand by 2025. In spite of this, countries continue to be 
heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy generation, raising questions on the 
long-term security of ASEAN’s energy supply as fossil fuel supply begins dwindling. 
In addition, it remains inhibitive for some countries to adopt alternative energy 
sources at a larger scale as they continue to grapple with other more urban challenges. 
Which alternative energy sources should ASEAN focus on? How can ASEAN ensure that no 
country gets left behind? Delegates of the AMEM will need to address these concerns 
in order to protect the energy security of the region while assessing the possible 
impacts on the climate in the years to come.

## 2. The Question of Energy Connectivity

An efficient, reliable and resilient electricity infrastructure plays a pivotal role 
in stimulating economic growth. Hence, enhancing energy connectivity is one of AMEM’s 
primary objectives. Nevertheless, the dream of a regional energy network remains a 
distant one as many countries have traditionally placed more emphasis on their own 
national energy development over regional energy objectives. Any delay in cooperation 
initiatives will be a missed opportunity for regional economic growth. Delegates therefore 
have to deliver concrete plans to enhance energy connectivity within the region while 
considering the massively different energy requirements between nations.
