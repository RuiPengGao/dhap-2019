## Coming soon

<!-- 
(AMMST) was established in 1980 upon the recognition of science
and technology (S&T) as a key factor in sustaining economic growth,
enhancing community well-being and promoting integration in
ASEAN. AMMST enables ASEAN to push forward to build a strong
S&T base, ensuring the global competitiveness of the region.
Therefore, delegates would be tasked to analyse the various issues
ASEAN faces in moving up the technological ladder.
The Question of the Transition toward Smart Cities
Rapid technological advancements have ushered in a new era in
which countries are seeking to move towards smart cities, which
support better living through the use of technology. Currently, the
ASEAN Smart Cities Network is the most prominent and inclusive
platform to facilitate the creation of smart cities. Yet, challenges
remain; for instance, differing levels of economic development
imply that not all countries are on the same starting line. Hence, as
representatives of their various countries, delegates will be
empowered to design strategies to ensure convenient and secure
digital transactions, build digital identities, and develop advanced
transport systems to help ASEAN collectively transition toward
smart cities.

## The Question of the Advancement of Biotechnology
Can Southeast Asia one day lead the world in biotechnology? Some
would answer “yes”, for countries like Singapore have already
established reputations as cutting-edge biotech hubs. New
discoveries can create tremendous opportunities for the region by
improving the quality of healthcare services, increasing agricultural
output, and paving the way for a cleaner environment. These
benefits, will in turn, contribute enormously to economic growth.
However, many hurdles prevent the region from fulfilling its
potential in this industry. These include the absence of clear policy
direction, the dearth of relevant infrastructure and widening intra-
regional disparities in level of technological advancement.
Delegates of the AMMST will be challenged to design strategies to
overcome these challenges such that the biotechnology industry in
Southeast Asia will flourish. -->
