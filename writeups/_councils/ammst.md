The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Science and Technology (AMMST)
was established in 1980 upon the recognition of science and technology
as a key factor in sustaining economic growth, enhancing community 
well-being and promoting integration in ASEAN. Delegates of AMMST will 
be tasked to analyse the various issues ASEAN faces in moving up the 
technological ladder. 

## 1. The Question of the Transition toward Smart Cities

Amidst an ongoing digital revolution, countries around the world are 
increasingly seeking to move towards the development of smart cities, which 
support better living through the use of technology. AMMST plays a critical role
in facilitating the adoption of relevant technologies. Yet, numerous obstacles
– including a lack of well-developed ecosystem of professionals – hinder 
countries’ smart cities ambition. Hence, delegates will be empowered to 
design strategies to promote convenient and secure digital transactions, 
build digital identities, and develop advanced transport systems to help 
ASEAN transition towards being smart cities.

## 2. The Question of the Advancement of Biotechnology

Can Southeast Asia one day lead the world in biotechnology? New discoveries 
have already begun to create tremendous opportunities for the region by improving 
the quality of healthcare services, increasing agricultural output, and paving the 
way for a cleaner environment. However, many hurdles prevent the region from 
fulfilling its potential in this industry. These include the absence of clear 
policy direction, a paucity of relevant infrastructure and widening intra-regional 
disparities in the level of technological advancement. Delegates of the AMMST will 
be challenged to craft solutions to overcome these challenges such that the 
biotechnology industry in Southeast Asia are able to flourish.
