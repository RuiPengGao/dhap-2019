In the latest instalment of the much-loved Historical Crisis Committee (HCC), 
delegates will traverse time and find themselves at the outset of the Battle for
Malaya during WWII. Delegates will be conferred the roles of prominent officials
within the British military and civilian government, and they will face the 
formidable challenge of repelling the impending Japanese invasion. Much will be 
at stake, for the island of Singapore – located at the tip of the Malayan peninsula
 – was a major British military base and a cornerstone of British imperial 
 defence. Delegates will experience the thrill of engaging in combat amidst 
 dealing with pressing economic and social issues. Delegates must challenge 
 themselves to act swiftly, decisively and effectively, for the security of 
 Malaya lies in their hands.
