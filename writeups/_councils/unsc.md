The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six organs of the 
United Nations. It aims to ensure peace, stability and security around the world. 
This council allows delegates to undertake the roles of diplomats of countries 
from around the world and discuss means to resolve pertinent global security issues. 
Set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, delegates can expect to relive some 
of the most contentious issues in a bipolar world, applying historical concepts 
such as empathy in the process. 

## 1. The Question of the Cuban Missile Crisis
 
The 16th of October 1962 marked the start of the intense confrontation between the 
United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), with Cuba serving 
as a proxy battleground. This was a grave situation as the world was on the brink of 
a nuclear war. Key issues include the security of the Central American region, superpower 
relations and nuclear proliferation. Throughout the course of debate, delegates will be 
required to consider the interests of the individual nation-states amidst the prevailing 
geopolitical climate, as well as how their individual nations shape their policies and 
stances to fit the Cold War. 

## 2. The Question of the Congo Crisis
 
The Congo Crisis saw the Katanga and South Kansai secessions escalating to an armed 
conflict. The situation was further complicated by the presence of superpowers with 
differing opinions of the conflict. The Congo Crisis exposed several structural 
flaws within the United Nations. Delegates can come up with measures to work 
within the structure of the fledgling United Nations and manoeuvre within the 
Cold War context to balance between the different expectations of the superpowers 
and achieve lasting peace and security within Congo.
