## Coming soon

<!-- The United Nations Security Council is one of the six organs of the
United Nations. It aims to ensure peace, stability and security
around the world. This council allows delegates to undertake the
roles of diplomats of countries around the world and discuss means
to resolve pertinent global security issues. Set in 1962 at the height
of the Cold War, delegates can expect to relive some of the most
contentious issues in a bipolar world, applying historical concepts
such as empathy in the process.

## The Question of the Cuban Missile Crisis
The 16th of October 1962 marked the start to the intense
confrontation between the United States and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (USSR), with Cuba having been the client state
of the latter. This was indeed a grave situation as the world was
collectively on the brink of a nuclear war. Even after the crisis, key
issues remained. These include the security of the Central American
region, superpower relations and nuclear proliferation. Through the
course of debate, delegates and required to consider their own
countryâ€™s interests as well as the prevailing geopolitical climate. This
will certainly aid them in raising both long- and short- term solutions
to restore peace and security to the world.


## The Question of the Congo Crisis
The Congo Crisis saw the Katanga and South Kansai secessions
culminating in an armed conflict. The situation was exacerbated
with superpowers supporting opposing forces in the fight, turning it
into a Cold War proxy conflict. With tensions mounting, pressure
from the superpowers and increasing concern from the international
community, it is up to delegates in the UNSC to find measures to
prevent such a crisis from reoccurring and to ensure long term
peace and stability of the region. What will post-Lumumba Congo
be like? This is a question only delegates will be able to answer. -->
