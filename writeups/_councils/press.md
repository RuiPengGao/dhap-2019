With the proliferation of fake news, the role of the press becomes 
increasingly crucial in upholding the truth. The Press Corps grants 
delegates an exclusive chance to step into the shoes of some of the most 
prominent press agencies in Southeast Asia and beyond. This will require 
delegates to be adept at managing inherent biases within their press agencies. 
Delegates of the Press Corps can look forward to forwarding the agenda of 
their respective agencies with reports that consolidate the proceedings of 
reach and every council.
