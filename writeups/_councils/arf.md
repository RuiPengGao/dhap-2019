Established in 1994, The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) brings 
together 27 member states for dialogue on political and security 
issues of common interest within the Asia-Pacific. The acknowledgement 
of its diverse membership has seen ARF advocate a measured approach towards 
security cooperation and open dialogue on critical issues concerning its member
states. This is evident from its adherence to ASEANâ€™s fundamental principles of 
consensus and consultation. 

## 1. The Question of E-commerce in the Asia-Pacific

As e-commerce becomes increasingly international, the retail supply chain will 
need to continuously evolve to keep up. While the potential of emerging e-commerce 
markets should never be underestimated, there exists infrastructural limitations in 
some economies within the Asia-Pacific which may affect the quality of service provided. 
At the same time, there is a need to keep up with rapidly evolving cybersecurity 
technologies to ensure safe e-commerce transactions. Delegates are thus expected to 
formulate solutions to overcome barriers for the Asia-Pacific to ensure the efficiency 
and security of e-commerce activities. 

## 2. The Question of Arms Trafficking in Southeast Asia

The spectre of rising extremism in Southeast Asia underscores the importance of 
clamping down on illegal arms trade in the region. Steps have been taken to regulate 
the trade in conventional arms with the signing of the global Arms Trade Treaty, 
which came into force in 2014. However, few states in the Asia-Pacific have ratified 
the treaty. In the years since, efforts to tighten arms transfer controls in the region 
appear to have stalled. In the ARF, delegates are expected to scrutinise existing 
frameworks to identify and close key loopholes which illegal traders continue to exploit, 
so as to ameliorate the unregulated flow of arms.
