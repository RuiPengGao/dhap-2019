## Coming soon

<!-- The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) serves as a consultative platform
for political and security issues of common interest within the Asia-
Pacific. Bringing together 27-member states, the forum has
contributed significantly towards confidence-building and
preventive diplomacy in the region since its establishment in 1994.
The acknowledgement of its diverse membership has seen ARF
advocate a measured approach towards security cooperation and
open dialogue on critical issues concerning its member states. This
is evident from its adherence to ASEANâ€™s fundamental principles of
consensus and consultation.

## The Question of E-commerce in the Asia-Pacific
As e-commerce becomes increasingly international, the retail
supply chain will need to continuously evolve to keep up. While the
potential of emerging e-commerce markets should never be
underestimated, there exist infrastructural limitations in some
economies within the Asia-Pacific which may affect the quality of
service provided. At the same time, there is a need to step up
cybersecurity within the region to ensure safe e-commerce
transactions. A recent survey reveals that the struggle to keep up
with the rapidly evolving cybersecurity technologies is the primary
barrier hindering Asia-Pacific organisations from ensuring secure
cyber environments. There is thus an increasing struggle to combat
sophisticated cyber threats and search for appropriate solutions to
address them.

Delegates are expected to formulate solutions to overcome
barriers for the Asia Pacific to achieve greater e-commerce
connectivity. Delegates are also expected to mitigate the existing
infrastructural and security limitations to strengthen cybersecurity in
the region.

## The Question of Arms Trafficking in Southeast Asia
The spectre of rising extremism in Southeast Asia underscores the
importance of clamping down on illegal arms trade in the region.
Steps have been taken to regulate the trade in conventional arms
with the signing of the global Arms Trade Treaty, which came into
force in 2014. However, few states in the Asia-Pacific have ratified
the treaty. In the years since, efforts to tighten arms transfer
controls in the region have appeared to stall. In the ARF, delegates
are expected to examine the limitations of existing
countermeasures in the Asia-Pacific in order to find and establish
mechanisms to control the unregulated flow of arms. Throughout
the course of debate, delegates are reminded to consider the
fundamental guiding principles of the ARF, which entail open
dialogue and consensus-building. -->
