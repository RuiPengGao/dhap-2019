  On behalf of the organising committee of the Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus 
  Summit (DHAP) 2019, I sincerely invite your institution to participate in DHAP 2019.


  DHAP is a simulation conference with a trademark focus on ASEAN,
  where students assume the roles of diplomatic leaders representing
  ASEAN member states and other international players to debate and discuss
  regional and international issues. With Singapore having completed her term
  as the 2018 ASEAN chair, DHAP is well-positioned to promote awareness of the
  importance of ASEAN amongst students.


  This year, we are expecting to host approximately 200 high school students aged 15 to 19
  from schools in Singapore and our overseas partner schools. DHAP 2019 will be held
  from 6 June 2019 (Thursday) to 8 June 2019 (Saturday) at Dunman High School. There
  will be a dinner on the evening of 7 June 2019 (Friday) for delegates to interact with
  their fellow delegates on a more personal level.


  The theme for DHAP 2019 is Interconnections. Interconnections builds on ASEAN 2019
  theme of Advancing Partnership for Sustainability, where ASEAN leaders continue to
  foster and deepen relationships within and beyond ASEAN partners. In the current
  geo-political landscape where countries are looking inwards, Interconnections is a
  reminder to delegates that ASEAN should continue to forge meaningful relations between
  countries in order to thrive and to remain relevant.


  Through DHAP, we hope to encourage delegates to voice their opinions and develop
  resolutions to regional and global issues. We also seek to cultivate a deeper appreciation
  for intergovernmental organisations such as ASEAN and the United Nations in delegates. DHAP
  provides an excellent platform for participants of various local and international
  institutions to come together and interact while developing a deeper understanding of the
  workings of international diplomacy and politics.


  For more information on how to register for DHAP, please visit our webpage at
  [http://dhaseanplus.com](http://dhaseanplus.com). For queries, please feel free to contact the DHAP Organising
  Committee at **aseanplus.communications@dhs.sg**.


  We look forward to welcoming your school at DHAP 2019.

  Thank you.

  The Executive Board oversees the various committees and topics that will be discussed
  during the conference. Each committee will discuss one or two topics. We are pleased to be
  continuing out three-tier council system this year, where Delegates will be allocated to
  councils of varying difficulties and intensities to provide a conducive and guided debating
  environment. ARF, AMMST and AMEM are beginner-friendly councils where delegates will be
  introduced to MUN and guided during council debate, while the UNSC is an
  intermediate-level council for delegates who have been to a number of conferences. The
  HCC is pitched for highly-experienced delegates who seek fast-paced debates and engaging
  simulations of political gridlocks.

  The Organising Committee is the backbone of the conference. We consist of four sub-committees, 
  each unique and crucial in their own ways, yet _interconnected_ to ensure that the conference 
  flows smoothly, maximising your DHAP experience. The Publicity and Communications 
  sub-committees helm the corporate relations aspect of DHAP, while the Project Planning and 
  Logistics sub-committees ensure that the programmes planned for you will become a reality.
