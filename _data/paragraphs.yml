  Dear Sir/Madam,  

  On behalf of the organising committee of the Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit
  (DHAP) 2019, I sincerely invite your institution to participate in DHAP 2019. DHAP is a
  simulation conference with a trademark focus on ASEAN, where students assume the roles
  of diplomatic leaders representing ASEAN member states and other international players to
  debate and discuss regional as well as international issues. As Singapore completes her term
  as the 2018 ASEAN chair, DHAP is well-positioned to promote awareness of the importance
  of ASEAN amongst students.  

  This year, we are expecting to host approximately 200 high school students aged 15 to 19
  from schools in Singapore and our overseas partner schools. DHAP 2019 will be held from 6
  June 2019 (Thursday) to 8 June 2019 (Saturday) at Dunman High School. There will be a
  dinner held in the evening of 7 June 2019 (Friday) for delegates to interact with their like-
  minded local and international peers on a more personal level.  

  Through DHAP, we hope to encourage delegates to voice their opinions and develop
  resolutions to regional and global issues. We also seek to cultivate a deeper appreciation for
  intergovernmental organisations such as ASEAN and the United Nations in delegates. DHAP
  provides an excellent platform for participants of various local and international institutions
  to come together and interact while developing a deeper understanding of the workings of
  international diplomacy and politics.  

  We look forward to welcoming your school at DHAP 2019. Thank you.

  The Executive Board oversees the various committees and topics that will be discussed
  during the conference. Each committee will discuss one or two topics. We are pleased to be
  continuing out three-tier council system this year, where Delegates will be allocated to
  councils of varying difficulties and intensities to provide a conducive and guided debating
  environment. AMMST and AMEM are beginner-friendly councils where delegates will be
  introduced to MUN and guided during council debate, while ARF and UNSC are an
  intermediate-level councils for delegates who have been to a number of conferences. The
  HCC is pitched for highly-experienced delegates who seek fast-paced debates and engaging
  simulations of political gridlocks.
