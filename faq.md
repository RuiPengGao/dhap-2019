1. **Who can participate in Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP)?**  
Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) is targeted at
students from 15 to 19 years old. Should you fall outside this age
group, we still encourage application, nevertheless, and will
process them on a case-by-case basis. Registration will be
processed on a first come, first served basis and the organisers
reserve the right to turn down registrations in the event of
oversubscription.

2. **Do I have a choice of council and country?**  
Delegates will have the opportunity to indicate their council
preferences when they register. However, the eventual allocation
will be assigned by the Secretariat.

3. **How many delegations can each school register?**  
Each school can register one delegation. There is no minimum
number or limit to the number of delegates per delegation.

4. **How can I register for DHAP 2019?**  
Registration can be made as a school delegation or an
independent delegate. Registration begins on 15 February 2019
and ends on 24 March 2019. To register, please fill up the form
which will be found under the 'Registration' tab of the DHAP 2019

5. **Will meals be provided during the conference?**  
Lunch will be provided on all three days of the conference, and
