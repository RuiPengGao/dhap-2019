# Theme
The theme for DHAP 2019 is “Interconnections”. This theme is a recognition of the broad
and deep relationships between ASEAN Member States (AMS), which span across many
fronts - including, inter alia, national security, trade, and a common regional history. At
DHAP, delegates would do well to be cognisant of the converging national interests of AMS
as they aspire to achieve shared objectives.

“Interconnections” also encapsulates the key objectives of the Summit. Delegates will
explore the intricate network of interconnections in three key domains: firstly, between
AMS, as many of the most salient issues faced by countries today are transnational in
nature; secondly, between issues, as political, economic and social problems are often
intertwined; and thirdly, between delegates themselves and international affairs, for
decisions made by policymakers have a subtle yet significant impact on the grassroots.
The logo reinforces the theme as the encircling strokes reflect the intertwined interests of
AMS, and the hands clasping each other reflects the spirit of cooperation underpinning the
ASEAN identity.
